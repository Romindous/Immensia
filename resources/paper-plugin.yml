dependencies:
  #bootstrap:
  # Let's say that RegistryPlugin registers some data that your plugin needs to use
  # We don't need this during runtime, so it's not required in the server section.
  # However, can be added to both if needed

  # load (BEFORE|AFTER|OMIT): Whether the plugin should load before or after your plugin.
  # required: Whether this plugin is required for your plugin to load.
  # join-classpath: Whether your plugin should have access to their classpath.
  # This is used for plugins that need to access other plugins internals directly.

  server:
    Ostrov: # Add a required "RequiredPlugin" dependency, which will load AFTER your plugin.

      required: false
